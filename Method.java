// its an very simple program that demonstrates how to call a method in Java.
// The add method calculates the sum of two integers and prints the result.
// The main method calls the add method and prints a message.
//void function without any parameters or return value.
// The add method is defined as static, allowing it to be called without creating an instance of the class.
// The main method serves as the entry point of the program.
// The program demonstrates basic method definition and invocation in Java.
// The add method performs a simple addition operation and prints the result.
// This program is a basic example of method usage in Java.
